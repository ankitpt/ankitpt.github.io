With the explosion of scientific literature, automated tools are essential for efficient knowledge discovery. This study analyzes a COVID-19 knowledge graph and applies graph embedding and machine learning to predict undiscovered links between concepts. Among the tested methods, SDNE with a neural network achieved the highest accuracy (F1-score: 88.0%), followed by GraphSAGE (86.3%). Predictions were ranked using PageRank product, offering insights into biomedical research connections.
