This study presents a normalized intensity thresholding and a deep learning approach with automated labeling for extracting lane markings from LiDAR data. The deep learning model with automated labels achieved the highest accuracy (F1-score: 84.9% in asphalt, 85.1% in concrete), outperforming traditional methods. Results highlight the limitations of intensity-based thresholding on concrete pavements and the effectiveness of deep learning across different surfaces, aiding in up-to-date HD map generation for autonomous vehicles.
