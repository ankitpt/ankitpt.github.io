This study enhances lane marking extraction from LiDAR point clouds using unsupervised intensity normalization and deep learning with automated labeling. Compared to traditional intensity thresholding, normalization improves extraction accuracy (F1-score: 78.9% vs. 72.3%), while deep learning trained on auto-labeled data outperforms manually labeled models (85.9% vs. 75.1%). Both deep learning approaches achieve better lane width estimation and gap detection, enabling more effective automated road monitoring and maintenance.
