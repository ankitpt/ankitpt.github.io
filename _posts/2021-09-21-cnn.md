Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), I trained models to classify dog breeds from images—first from scratch, then using transfer learning with VGG16 and ResNet50. The results? Explore the power of deep learning, transfer learning, and surprising model quirks (like predicting a human as a Black Russian Terrier). Full code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ankitpt/dog_breed_classifier).
