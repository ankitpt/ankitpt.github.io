I'm Ankit, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between AI and real-world applications. Currently, I'm a Founding ML Engineer at SigIQ.ai, where I develop AI-driven learning experiences for exam preparation. I've helped build our flagship product: [PadhAI](https://padhai.ai/), an app for Indian Civil Services exam preparation with over 175,000 users. My work on PadhAI's AI-powered news feature has become one of the most engaged-with tools in the app, helping thousands of aspirants connect current events with their exam preparation.

My past work spans computer vision and deep learning, with applications ranging in 3D spatial intelligence at [Matterport](https://matterport.com) and nuclear reactor optimization at [Blue Wave AI Labs](https://bluewaveailabs.com). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from IIT Kanpur (2018) and later pursued an MS at Purdue University (2020). At Purdue, I worked with Dr. Ayman Habib in the [Digital Photogrammetry Research Group](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/Academics/Groups/Geomatics/DPRG) on lane marking extraction from LiDAR point clouds. My research led to publications exploring deep learning and transfer learning for lane marking detection.
