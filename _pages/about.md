I'm Ankit, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between AI and real-world applications. Currently, I'm a Founding ML Engineer at SigIQ.ai, where I design AI-driven learning experiences for exam preparation, helping students engage with personalized, high-impact study tools. My past work spans computer vision and deep learning, with applications ranging in 3D spatial intelligence at [Matterport](https://matterport.com) and nuclear reactor optimization at [Blue Wave AI Labs](https://bluewaveailabs.com).

Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from IIT Kanpur (2018) and later pursued an MS at Purdue University (2020), where I worked with Dr. Ayman Habib on lane marking extraction from LiDAR point clouds. My research led to publications exploring deep learning and transfer learning for lane marking detection.
